# üó∫Ô∏è My Personal Finance App Journey

Hey there! Ready to build something awesome? Here's my roadmap to create a desktop personal finance app from complete scratch. 

**What I'm building:** A desktop app that lets me import CSV bank statements, create budgets, track spending, and plan for my financial goals.

**My tech stack:** Rust (for the heavy lifting), Tauri (for the desktop interface), and SQLite (to store my data locally).

**Starting point:** Complete beginner with zero Rust or Tauri experience
**Goal:** Have a working MVP in about 4-5 months

## üîß Phase 0: Getting My Feet Wet (1-2 weeks)

**What I'll learn:** The basics of Rust and Tauri so I can actually build stuff.

**My milestones:**

* [ ] **Dive into Rust**
  * Install the Rust toolchain (`rustup`, `cargo`)
  * Work through [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) or [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) - pick whichever feels right to me
* [ ] **Say Hello to Tauri**
  * Get Node.js and the Tauri CLI installed
  * Create my first "Hello World" app with Tauri - this will feel amazing when it works!
* [ ] **Set up my workspace**
  * Create a GitHub repo and organize my project folders

---

## üìÇ Phase 1: Building My Data Foundation (2-3 weeks)

**What I'll build:** The core structure for handling transactions and importing my bank data.

**My milestones:**

* [ ] **Design my transaction model**
  * Figure out what fields I need: date, amount, description, category
  * Set up SQLite with `SeaORM` or `Diesel` (whichever clicks better for me)
* [ ] **Create my CSV import magic**
  * Write Rust code that reads my bank's CSV files and turns them into structured data
  * Add error handling so it doesn't crash when files are weird
* [ ] **Store everything locally**
  * Get those imported transactions safely into my SQLite database

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Phase 2: My First Desktop App (3-4 weeks)

**What I'll create:** A real desktop application with a GUI that actually works!

**My milestones:**

* [ ] **Build my app window**
  * Set up Tauri with a webview UI (React, Svelte, or vanilla - my choice!)
* [ ] **Add file import functionality**
  * Create a button that lets me pick CSV files
  * Connect my frontend to my Rust backend so clicking actually imports data
* [ ] **Show my transactions**
  * Display my imported data in a nice table that I can sort and filter

---

## üí∞ Phase 3: Budget Like a Pro (3-4 weeks)

**What I'll add:** The ability to set monthly budgets and see how I'm doing.

**My milestones:**

* [ ] **Extend my database**
  * Add tables for storing monthly budgets by category
* [ ] **Create budget input forms**
  * Build a nice UI where I can set how much I want to spend on groceries, entertainment, etc.
* [ ] **Track my spending vs budget**
  * Compare what I actually spent against what I planned
  * Show progress bars and summaries so I can see at a glance how I'm doing

---

## üîÆ Phase 4: Plan My Financial Future (3-4 weeks)

**What I'll build:** Tools to help me understand trends and reach my goals.

**My milestones:**

* [ ] **Add forecasting magic**
  * Analyze my spending patterns to predict what next month might look like
* [ ] **Create goal tracking**
  * Let users set goals like "Save $500 in 3 months"
  * Track progress and show how close I am to hitting my targets
* [ ] **Build beautiful reports**
  * Create charts showing spending over time, category breakdowns, and goal progress

---

## üöÄ Phase 5: Polish and Launch (2-3 weeks)

**What I'll perfect:** Making my app feel professional and ready for others to use.

**My milestones:**

* [ ] **Make it look amazing**
  * Add dark mode, helpful tooltips, keyboard shortcuts
  * Polish all my UI components until they feel smooth
* [ ] **Protect my data**
  * Add backup/restore functionality
  * Optional encryption for sensitive financial data
* [ ] **Package it up**
  * Build installers for macOS and Windows
  * Release my MVP on GitHub with proper documentation

## üß© Dream Big: Future Ideas for Later

Once I've got my MVP working, here are some cool features I might want to add:

* Support for different bank CSV formats
* Smart transaction categorization using AI
* Cloud sync via Dropbox or Supabase
* Mobile companion app
* Advanced analytics and dashboards

**Remember:** This is my journey! I won't stress if I fall behind schedule - the important thing is that I'm building something real and learning along the way. Every line of code I write is progress, and every bug I fix makes me a better developer.

Good luck, and happy coding! üöÄ
